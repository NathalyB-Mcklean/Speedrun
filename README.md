To be honest, I just created this project to learn more about different programming languages and how to use them in specific situations. The name "Speedrun" was chosen randomly (or not).

Objective:
This project is a basic web page designed to display data obtained from an Arduino sensor (or sum like that).

Usage:
Just, use it  responsibly.

Contributing:
Feel free to fork this repository, make changes, and submit pull requests. Any contributions are warmly welcomed!

Credits:
Inspiration for this project came from: My bestfriend that had a project. xd
